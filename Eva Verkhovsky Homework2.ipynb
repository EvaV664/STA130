    "Summary:\n",
    "- Explanation of the Monty Hall Problem: The Monty Hall problem is a probability puzzle where you choose one of three doors, behind one of which is a car and behind the others are goats. After your choice, the host reveals a goat behind one of the other two doors, and you have the option to switch to the remaining door. The probability of winning if you switch is 2/3, while sticking with the original choice gives a 1/3 chance.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Original Code Review: The original code simulates the Monty Hall problem but is complex due to handling door removals and re-adding doors. It uses a try-except block to manage door lists, which can be less intuitive and cluttered.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Improved Code: A streamlined version of the simulation is provided, which simplifies the process using list comprehensions and direct operations. This version improves readability and makes the logical flow clearer."
